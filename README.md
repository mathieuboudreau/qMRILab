# qMTLab

qMTlab is a powerful, open source, scalable, easy to use and intuitive software for qMTI data simulation, fitting and analysis. The software consists of two parts:
1) a qMT data simulator
2) a qMT data fitting and visualization interface

The simulation part allows end users to easily simulate qMT data using the above described methods, evaluate how well these models perform under known parameters input, determine the most appropriate acquisition protocol and evaluate how fitting constraints impact the results. The data fitting part provides a simple interface to import real-world qMT data, fit them using the selected fitting procedure, and visualize the resulting parameters maps.

## Documentation

For a quick introduction to qMTLab functionnalities, see the [qMTLab PowerPoint e-poster](https://github.com/neuropoly/qMTLab/raw/master/qMTLab-Presentation.ppsx) which was presented at the 2016 ISMRM conference. You can also watch the presentation on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/WG0tVe-SFww).

## Installation

Installing qMTLab is easy and hassle-free! All you need is a supported version of MATLAB installed, no additional software is required. 

The latest stable version of qMTLab can be downloaded freely [here](https://github.com/neuropoly/qMTLab/tarball/master).

* Alternatively, you can clone the git repository from GitHub using this link: _https://github.com/neuropoly/qMTLab.git_ 

* If you have a GitHub account (free) and wish to contribute to the software, you can go to [https://github.com/neuropoly/qMTLab](https://github.com/neuropoly/qMTLab) and fork the repository to your account. If you make any contribution to the software that you feel should be included in the project, please make a pull request so that we can review your modifications before including them in the project.

Once you have downloaded and extract the *.zip file or cloned the repository, start MATLAB, navigate to the qMTLab folder, and in the Command Window type `qMTLab` and hit enter. After a few seconds of loading, you should be presented with a graphical user interface (GUI) and you're ready to start simulating or processing qMT data!
